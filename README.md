# Image Jam - A Cloudflare Images Tutorial Website

This is the source code of a Cloudflare Pages website used by this [Cloudflare Images tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/cloudflare-images/tutorials/cloudflare-images-on-pages).

See the Cloudflare Pages website running at <https://imagejam.net>.

## Tutorial Steps

This website illustrates several steps in the progression of the tutorial.

ðŸ‘‰ The only difference in every step: **the URLs to the website images** ðŸ‘ˆ

Step 1 shows a website not using Cloudflare Images,  
Step 2 and 3 change the images URLs to leverage Cloudflare Images,  
and Step 4 show how Cloudflare Images can be fully integrated without having to change any existing image URL.  

### Step 1: no Cloudflare Images

Live at <https://imagejam.net/step-1/>

Presents a website serving images without using Cloudflare Images ðŸ™ˆ

ðŸ‘‰ We use this step as a basis for the integration of Cloudflare Images.

Image URLs look like: https://imagejam.net/images/public/cakes/aliet-kitchen-qrDbj7OV2EU-unsplash-ãƒ„.jpg

### Step 2: Cloudflare Images width default delivery domain

Live at <https://imagejam.net/step-2/>

Presents a website serving images from Cloudflare Images, on the default delivery domain https://imagedelivery.net

ðŸ‘‰ This step and the following suppose that the images used by the website have been imported on Cloudflare Images; see [migration](#Migration) about this

Image URLs look like: https://imagedelivery.net/-oMiRxTrr3JCvTMIzx4GvA/cakes/aliet-kitchen-qrDbj7OV2EU-unsplash-ãƒ„.jpg/public

### Step 3: Cloudflare Images with custom delivery domain

Live at <https://imagejam.net/step-3/>

Presents a website serving images from Cloudflare Images on a custom delivery domain.

ðŸ‘‰ Demonstrates how one can serve Cloudflare Images on their own donmain with zero setup.

### Step 4: Cloudflare Images on existing Images URL

Live at <https://imagejam.net/step-3/>

Presents a website serving images from Cloudflare Images, keeping the Images on their unchanged existing URL.

ðŸ‘‰ Demonstrates how low profile the integration of Cloudflare Images can be in your system, requiring zero change in the HTML of your existing website and in the URLs of your existing images.

ðŸ‘‰ This is achieved by a simple Cloudflare Worker that relays image trafic to Cloudflare Images. See the source code for this worker in [`/images-worker`](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net/tree/production/images-worker) on this repo.

## Migrating the website Images to Cloudflare Images

Beginning with 

## Generate the website and browse it locally

Requirements:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) 16.15 (LTS) or newest, with NPM.

After checking out the code, run `npm install` at the root of the project to install dependencies.

This repo embeds a very basic static website generator, that takes the website source present in `src/`, and generates static HTML ready to be served in `dist/`.

To generate the website, run:

```sh
npm run generate
```

This will generate the steps of the tutorial.

To browse the generated website, run:

```sh
npm run serve
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8080> in your browser.

### DRAFT

TODO: make the tutorial installable on own zone?
### Branch [01-start](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net/tree/01-start)

In this branch, the website serves original, unoptimized images directly from Amazon S3. We use this state as the starting point for our Cloudflare Images integration.

### Branch [02-migrate](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net/tree/02-migrate)

In this branch, we introduce scripts that upload all of our website images into Cloudflare Images storage.

To upload all the website images to Cloudflare images:

```
npm install

# Find the value for CF_IMAGES_ACCOUNT_ID in the Cloudflare Dashboard, section Images, under `Account ID`
export CF_IMAGES_ACCOUNT_ID=...

# A Cloudflare API token valid for the account, with Read and Update permissions on Cloudflare Images
# See https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/tokens/create/
export CF_IMAGES_API_KEY=...

npm run bulkupload
```

Once done, the images have been uploaded from Amazon S3 to Cloudflare Images.

### Branch [03-serve-from-cf-images](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net/tree/03-serve-from-cf-images)

In this branch, the images are served by Cloudflare Images, on the default delivery domain https://imagedelivery.net

### Branch [04-custom-domain](https://github.com/netgusto/imagejam.net/tree/04-custom-domain)

In this branch, the images are served by Cloudflare Images on a custom domain.
